# FreeCodeCamp: APIs and Microservices Project #3 - URL Shortnener

FreeCodeCamp's third APIs and Microservices project, completed. This is part of the APIs and Microservices certification. You can find the hosted project at [this link](https://boilerplate-project-urlshortener.andyarensman.repl.co/). This project demonstrates understanding of MongoDB and Mongoose.

Here are [FreeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/url-shortener-microservice) requirements to complete the project:
>You can POST a URL to `/api/shorturl` and get a JSON response with `original_url` and `short_url` properties. Here's an example: `{ original_url : 'https://freeCodeCamp.org', short_url : 1}`
>
>When you visit `/api/shorturl/<short_url>`, you will be redirected to the original URL.
>
>If you pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid `http://www.example.com` format, the JSON response will contain `{ error: 'invalid url' }`
